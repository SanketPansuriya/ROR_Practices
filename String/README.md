### which should we prefer strings and symbols ? and why ?
#### Answer
> Depends on the What we need ```"If the textual content of the object is important, use a String. If the identity of the object is important, use a Symbol.‚Äù``` ~Jim Weirich <br><br>
> The immutable nature of symbols makes them very valuable in programming because mutable objects can cause bugs that are difficult to detect. Since symbols stay the same, using them helps to avoid this issue. <br><br>
